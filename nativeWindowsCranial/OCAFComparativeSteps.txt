Comparative:
*OPTIONAL*1. Make sure number of files is 2
*OPTIONAL*2. For each, if size is greater than 2 megabytes:
	a. QuadricEdgeDecimation and output to stage with same name
	b. else just copy to stage with same name
3. Run CPD preprocessing
4. Run CPD registration, output not Update only COR to stage
5. Run Compute Curvature, output principal curvature files 
6. Run Change3DFile, output to stage
7. Run ComparativePreProcessing, output combined + other files to stage
8. Run ComparitiveAnalysis
    a. Output file with RAFS LAFS and AS for both inputs when user hits b (?)
    b. Output file with relative changed surface area for max,min,mean,gaussian w/ thresholds of .25,.5,.75
    c. Keep window open so peeps can keep cycling through and screenshot

Normative:
1. Change error weight to less (/2) to allow more drastic merging effects
