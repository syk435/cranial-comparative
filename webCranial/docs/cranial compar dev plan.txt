cranial code:
 - setup webserver + browserify single-page client + async [CHECK]

 - node secure login quick setup [CHECK] 
   * also you can just do app.get("/some_random_id", (req, res) => res.send(200))

 - automate file upload [CHECK]
   * put button [CHECK]
   * user browse to file path -> load via three.js obj reader [CHECK]

 - launch python script with path parameters [CHECK]
   * async child_process call to kick off stand-alone python process that dies when done [CHECK]
   * edit python script to use param as file name, and to write to local file when done [CHECK]
   * callback to update mesh coloring w/ curvature [CHECK]
   * if triggered, launch python curv. script and on success launch loadModel with coloring w/ curv and faces
	-where to get filename from? previously from the form...maybe it's still there? [CHECK]

 - github [CHECK]
   * git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch "*.sdf" HEAD
